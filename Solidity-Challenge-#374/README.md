### What Went Wrong?
Potential reentrancy issue when transferring rewards.
No proper error handling for zero balance in the contract.

### Example
If multiple users claim rewards simultaneously, a reentrancy attack could drain the contract balance.

### Solution
Use a checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy.
Add a check for zero balance in the contract before transferring rewards.
